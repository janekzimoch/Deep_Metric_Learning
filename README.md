# Deep_Metric_Learning (portfolio repository)
This repository contains my code and report for a project on image similarity classification using Deep Metric Learning. All code was written by myself (some components such as data loading, data Generator, and CNN architectures were hugely inspired/based on the solutions available on the internet). The project was completed in two weeks and it was the first time I wrote such an extensive program, with several modules distriuted across multiple directories (which is why it looks so messy - with tight time constraints I didn't have time to clean it). It was also my very first time using Keras and Deep Metric Learning, thus I am super happy with the outcome and the progres i have made just in 2 weeks!
